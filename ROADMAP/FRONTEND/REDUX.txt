
### 1. **Introduction to Redux**
   - What is Redux?
   - Why use Redux with React?
   - Key Principles of Redux:
     - **Single Source of Truth**
     - **State is Read-Only**
     - **Changes are Made with Pure Functions**

### 2. **Setting Up Redux in a React Project**
   - Installing Redux and React-Redux
   - Creating the Redux Store
   - Setting up `Provider` to connect Redux with React

### 3. **Core Concepts of Redux**
   - **Actions**: What are actions and how to define them?
   - **Reducers**: Writing reducer functions
   - **Store**: What is the Redux store and how to create it?
   - **Dispatching Actions**: How to dispatch actions to the store

### 4. **Working with Actions**
   - Action Types: Defining constants for action types
   - Action Creators: Writing functions to return actions
   - Dispatching Actions: How to dispatch actions from React components

### 5. **Working with Reducers**
   - Writing Reducer Functions to handle state updates
   - Handling Multiple Actions in Reducers
   - Using `combineReducers` to manage multiple reducers

### 6. **Connecting Redux with React**
   - Using `react-redux` library
   - `connect()` function: Mapping Redux state and dispatch to React component props
   - `useSelector()` hook: Accessing state in functional components
   - `useDispatch()` hook: Dispatching actions in functional components

### 7. **Basic State Management**
   - Storing simple data in Redux (e.g., strings, numbers, booleans)
   - Updating state in response to actions (e.g., changing text, toggling visibility)
   - Handling simple interactions like button clicks with Redux

### 8. **Redux DevTools**
   - Installing Redux DevTools extension
   - Inspecting actions and state changes using DevTools
   - Time Travel Debugging with DevTools

### 9. **Handling Asynchronous Actions**
   - Introduction to Asynchronous Actions in Redux
   - Using Redux Thunk for async actions (e.g., API calls)
   - Dispatching multiple actions in response to async events
