
#### 1. **Introduction to Microservices**
   - What are Microservices?
   - Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture
   - Benefits and Challenges of Microservices
   - Use Cases for Microservices
   - Microservices Design Principles

#### 2. **Microservices Architecture**
   - Decomposition Strategies (e.g., by business capability, domain-driven design)
   - Communication Patterns (Synchronous vs Asynchronous)
   - Event-Driven Architecture
   - API Gateway Design
   - Service Discovery
   - Load Balancing

#### 3. **Designing Microservices**
   - Designing for Independence and Autonomy
   - Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
     - Bounded Contexts
     - Aggregates and Entities
   - Event Sourcing
   - CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
   - Designing APIs for Microservices (REST, gRPC, GraphQL)

#### 4. **Microservices Data Management**
   - Database per Service Pattern
   - Shared Databases vs. Independent Databases
   - Event-Driven Data Consistency (Eventual Consistency, Saga Pattern)
   - Data Replication and Caching

#### 5. **Service Communication and Integration**
   - Synchronous Communication (HTTP/REST, gRPC, WebSockets)
   - Asynchronous Communication (Message Queues, Kafka, RabbitMQ)
   - API Gateway Patterns
   - Inter-Service Authentication and Authorization

#### 6. **Microservices Security**
   - Authentication and Authorization (OAuth2, JWT)
   - Secure Service-to-Service Communication (TLS, mTLS)
   - Secrets Management (Vault, Kubernetes Secrets)
   - Rate Limiting and Throttling

#### 7. **Building and Deploying Microservices**
   - Docker for Microservices
   - Containerization Best Practices
   - Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
   - Kubernetes for Microservices Orchestration
     - Pods and Services
     - Helm for Kubernetes Package Management
   - Monitoring and Logging (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack)

#### 8. **Testing Microservices**
   - Unit Testing and Integration Testing
   - Consumer-Driven Contract Testing (e.g., Pact)
   - End-to-End Testing
   - Chaos Engineering

#### 9. **Service Management and Monitoring**
   - Distributed Tracing (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin)
   - Centralized Logging and Log Aggregation
   - Health Checks and Metrics
   - Circuit Breaker Pattern (e.g., Hystrix, Resilience4j)
   - Service Mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd)

#### 10. **Microservices Scalability and Fault Tolerance**
   - Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling
   - Auto-Scaling with Kubernetes
   - Load Balancing and Fault Tolerance Strategies
   - Implementing Retries and Backoff
